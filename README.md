Business Requirements Document (Project One) & System Design Document (Project Two) for DriverPass
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
   
The client for this project is DriverPass, a start-up that aims to help new drivers pass their driving exam and earn their license. The client requested a digital foundation for a training platform that includes lesson scheduling, practice tests, and payment      processing. 

3. What did you do particularly well?
   
I believe I did well keeping the design rigorous and readable. My diagrams are neat and easy to understand. Security was considered and implemented in every tier. The information flows well and is easy for those with less engineering expertise to follow. 

3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
   
I would revisit the manual DMV update issue. Automating it using an external feed would make more sense, given the sensitive nature of these changes.

4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
   
Interpreting the user's means being able to place yourself in their shoes. How do they interact with the system? What issues could they potentially face? Using real-world tasks and questions to define the system's functions was pivotal in the design. If we do not understand how users will utilize a system, we cannot appropriately design a system.
   
5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
   
My approach to software design has been an iterative cycle. I tend to gather user stories, sketch out models, validate the designs, refine the designs, and add security and scaling objectives. The future forecasts increased dependence on domain-driven design workshops and fast production of prototypes/demos. These will ensure ideas can be tested with more urgency and user needs can be met with precision.
